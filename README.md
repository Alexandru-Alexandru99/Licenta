<div style="text-align: justify">
This thesis presents a web platform, which provides an overview of the changes made at each stage of the project by viewing them in an interactive way, helping to determine the contributions made and providing a way to see the evolution of the code. In addition, this platform brings a number of functionalities closely related to the evolution of the code. Possibility to automatically identify unusual events in the evolution of a code, by identifying the large pieces of code introduced from one stage of the project to another. Detecting a group of students who collaborated in order to accomplish a task, by calculating the changes made by them. Checking code security by analyzing memory allocations and detecting blockages. Receiving certain explanations based on the code (calculating complexity, fixing bugs) by analyzing it. Checking the correctness of the code, by validating, testing and executing it. Extracting certain features that provide information about the students contribution, their weekly changes, how much is brought in addition to each stage of the project. Evaluate students based on the characteristics extracted, by creating a model that allows the award of a grade. Detection of groups of students who collaborated, based on the extracted characteristics, clustering these groups based on the distances calculated between these feature vectors.
